        <p class="r1">In many countries where drinking starts from a younger age, college students already know how to drink
          responsibly. Instead of feeling compelled to drink as much and as quickly as possible, they have learned to
          drink a reasonable amount in a reasonable amount of time. Also, if we could start drinking at a younger age,
          college students wouldn't feel the need to sneak around and hide their alcohol or drunk state. Lowering
          the drinking age could make a safer America for today's college students.</p>

      <div class="reasond2">
        <img src="Images/fakeId.jpg" alt="fakeID" width="320" height="180" align="left" />
        <p class="r2">Many college students buy fake ID's so that they can aquire alcohol. If they are caught with a fake
        ID, or alcohol, a student could get in trouble or even arrested for being in possession of these items. College
        students are putting their futures at risk because they have to sneak alcohol and can only obtain it illegaly.
        if the drinking age were lowered, then students wouldn't be risking their futures for a simple party</p>

      <div class="reasond3">
        <img src="Images/passedOut.png" alt="passedOut" width="320" height="180" align="left" />
        <p class="r3">College students drink every weekend. It's just something most of them do. However, sometimes a college
        student will consume too much alohol. This can lead to alohol poisoning. However, because most fear getting
        caught or getting in trouble becuase of their intoxication, they won't seek the medical help thats needed.
        This can put students at risk of serious internal injuries or even death. Student's would feel safe enough to go
        seek medical help if they could legally drink. Less kids would die if the drinking age were just lowered.</p>
